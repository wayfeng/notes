** Delete Unwanted Whitespaces[fn:1]
   Add to =.vimrc=
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
  " for one type of file

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Moving lines
   Reverse lines between /m/ and /n/:
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
  :<m>,<n>g/^/m<m-1>
#+END_SRC

** Marks[fn:2]
   - =ma= set a mark at current cursor position with name =a=.
   - =`a= jump to mark =a=.
   - =X'a= execute command =X= from current position to mark =a=.

** Macros
   - Press *q* to start record, followed by a lowercase character (or number) to name the macro;
   - Editing action will be recorded;
   - Press *q* again to stop recording;
   - Press <repetition>@<macro name> to apply the macro.

* Windows and Buffers
** multiple windows
   - [:split filename] split window and load another file
   - [:vsplit filename] vertical split
   - [:only] keep only this window open
   - [:hide] hide current window
   - [ctrl-w_] maximize current window
   - [ctrl-w=] make size of all windows equal
   - [ctrl-w ctrl-w] move cursor to another window
   - [ctrl-w L] move current window to far right
   - [ctrl-w H] move current window to far left
   - [ctrl-w J] move current window to very bottom
   - [ctrl-w K] move current window to very top
   - [:qa] quit from all windows

   To always enable status line, put =set laststatus=2= in =~/.vimrc=.
   See =:help laststatus= for more information.

** buffers
   To get list of buffers, try =:buffers= or =:ls= or =:files=.

   To switch buffer by name, try =:buffer <filename>= or =:buf <filename>= or even =:b <filename>=

   To close a buffer, try =:bd= or =:bw=.

* Programming
** tags
  To generate tags file for VIM
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ctags --recurse
#+END_SRC

  Some C++ code declares =class= like this
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
class MANAGED MyClass {
  ...;
};
#+END_SRC
  or like this
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
struct MANAGED MyStruct {
  ...;
};
#+END_SRC
  To let =ctags= handle it correctly, we'll need regular expressions.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ctags --regex-c++='/(struct|class) +MANAGED +([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)/\2/'
#+END_SRC

  Best way of Exuberant Ctags is to use =identifier-list=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ctags -I MANAGED -R
#+END_SRC

  Some C++ code are more confusing like this one
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
  class PACKED(4) MyClass FINAL {
    ...;
  }
#+END_SRC

  Use =identifier-list= as
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ctags -I PACKED+,FINAL -R
#+END_SRC

  Following command will start vi and put cursor in where the 'tag' is.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  vi -t `tag-you-want-to-search'
#+END_SRC
  Or, you can also find a 'tag' in vi.
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
  :ta `tag-you-want-to-search'
#+END_SRC

  When there are multiple locations found
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:ts(elect) `tag-you-want'
#+END_SRC

  Useful key bindings

| *Ctrl-]* | Find tag under the cursor.                      |
| *Ctrl-t* | Return to previous location before jump to tag. |

For more information, see =:help tags=.

** Folding setting
  - automatically folding functions
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:set foldmethod=syntax
#+END_SRC
  - open/close a fold block
    - *z c* fold a block
    - *z C* fold every possible block
    - *z o* open a folder, without sub-folders
    - *z O* open all sub-folders
  - more information
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:help folding
#+END_SRC

** HEX mode
  Vim does not have a hex mode, use xxd can stream file into hex.
  - enter hex mode
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:%!xxd
#+END_SRC
  - exit hex mode
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:%!xxd -r
#+END_SRC
  So this method will change the file, you can always press =u= to recover.

** cscope
*** Generate cscope ref file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cscope -Rb
#+END_SRC
*** Use cscope ref file in vim
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
:cs add cscope.out
#+END_SRC

*** Keybindings
    Example of keybindings in  =~/.vimrc=
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
  " cscope settings
  if has("cscope")
      " use both cscope and ctag for 'ctrl-]', ':ta', and 'vim -t'
      set cscopetag

      " check cscope for definition of a symbol before checking ctags: set to 1
      " if you want the reverse search order.
      set csto=0

      " add any cscope database in current directory
      if filereadable("cscope.out")
          cs add cscope.out
      " else add the database pointed to by environment variable
      elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
          cs add $CSCOPE_DB
      endif

      " show msg when any other cscope db added
      set cscopeverbose

      """"""""""""" My cscope/vim key mappings
      "
      " The following maps all invoke one of the following cscope search types:
      "
      "   's'   symbol: find all references to the token under cursor
      "   'g'   global: find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
      "   'c'   calls:  find all calls to the function name under cursor
      "   't'   text:   find all instances of the text under cursor
      "   'e'   egrep:  egrep search for the word under cursor
      "   'f'   file:   open the filename under cursor
      "   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
      "   'd'   called: find functions that function under cursor calls
      "
      " Below are three sets of the maps: one set that just jumps to your
      " search result, one that splits the existing vim window horizontally and
      " diplays your search result in the new window, and one that does the same
      " thing, but does a vertical split instead (vim 6 only).
      "
      " I've used CTRL-\ and CTRL-@ as the starting keys for these maps, as it's
      " unlikely that you need their default mappings (CTRL-\'s default use is
      " as part of CTRL-\ CTRL-N typemap, which basically just does the same
      " thing as hitting 'escape': CTRL-@ doesn't seem to have any default use).
      " If you don't like using 'CTRL-@' or CTRL-\, , you can change some or all
      " of these maps to use other keys.  One likely candidate is 'CTRL-_'
      " (which also maps to CTRL-/, which is easier to type).  By default it is
      " used to switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode.
      "
      " All of the maps involving the <cfile> macro use '^<cfile>$': this is so
      " that searches over '#include <time.h>" return only references to
      " 'time.h', and not 'sys/time.h', etc. (by default cscope will return all
      " files that contain 'time.h' as part of their name).


      " To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the
      " cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).  The result of your cscope
      " search will be displayed in the current window.  You can use CTRL-T to
      " go back to where you were before the search.
      "

      """"""""""""" key map timeouts
      "
      " By default Vim will only wait 1 second for each keystroke in a mapping.

      " either turn off mapping timeouts via 'notimeout'.
      "
      "set notimeout

      " Or, you can keep timeouts, by uncommenting the timeoutlen line below,
      " with your own personal favorite value (in milliseconds):
      "

      "
      " Either way, since mapping timeout settings by default also set the
