* The key principles of Presentation Zen:
- Restraint in presentation.
- Simplicity in design.
- Naturalness in delivery.

* /Six senses/ of a whole new mind, presentations in /conceptual age/
- Design :: not decoration, happens from the beginning
- Story :: we're designed to be story tellers and receivers
- Symphony :: see the bigger picture, take care of what is the most impotant
- Empathy :: see things from position of others
- Play :: don't be too serious
- Meaning :: make a difference to both you and your audiences

* Seth Godin: /presentation is about the transfer of emotion/
- No more than six words on a slide.
- Use professional images instead of cheesy images.
- No dissolves, spins, or other transitions. Keep it simple.
- Create a written document.

* Creativity, limitations, and constraints
- Presentation is a creative art.
  - Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Willing to be wrong.
  - Start with the beginner's mind.
  - Be bold.
  - Do not force it.
  - Embrace your enthusiasm.
- Restrictions, constraints and limitations are not enemies.
- Keep these three words in mind: *simplicity*, *clarity*, and *brevity*.

* Planning analog

* Crafting the story
