* Terminal Emulator

** Mononoki font cannot be found by gnome terminal since ubuntu 18.04
   This issue is caused by mis-typing of mononoki font as a none mono.
   To force gnome terninal use it, install =dconf-editor=, find
   =/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profile:/:<uuid>/font=, type =mononoki <size>=
   in "Custom value".

   Or use other terminal emulators such as =terminator= which comes with more 
   features such as split window.
